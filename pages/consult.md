* I can undertake consulting assignments, primarily in linux domain.
* Virtualization: I can also assist in setting up a  KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) environment and/or troubleshooting it.
* I can also work on linux kernel to fix any of the issues you may be facing, be it performance related or security. I can also work on feature additions and regression fixes and syncing it with LKML.
* Linux userland: I have also worked on several linux userland tools/packages with upstream and  and can help with that too.  I also work on LAMP stacks, with LAMP here not restricted to their Apache, MySQL but anything that fits the stack.
